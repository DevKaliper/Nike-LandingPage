                    <p><span>The Air Jordan s1</span> were the first of their kind. First released in 1985, this sneaker revolutionized the way  <span> The Air Jordan 1</span> was designed by Peter Moore and was released in 1985. The release was tied to Michael Jordanâ€™s rookie season in the NBA. The design of  <span>the Jordan 1</span>  was rather simple and consistent with the other basketball shoes of the era.  <span> The Jordan 1</span> lacked the sophisticated technology that the Jordan Brand would be known for with later installments. Nike was dedicated to giving Michael Jordan his own shoe and brand to grow with.  </p>
